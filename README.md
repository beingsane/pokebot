# Update June 22, 2018 - No Longer Maintained
This project is now out of date and currently does not have a workaround to identify Pokemon within the browser. I may make a bot in python or javascript (node) in the future but for now, I would suggest alternatives such as https://github.com/Hyperclaw79/PokeBall-SelfBot.

# Pokécord Bot
A bot to catch wild Pokémon and train them by spamming.

Knowledge of React and JavaScript will make it easier to understand and modify this bot.

## Quick Start
You may use the bot at [https://pokebot.davyvong.com/](https://pokebot.davyvong.com/) or run your own local server using the steps below.
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Open command prompt or terminal and navigate to the repository directory.
3. Install dependencies by using `npm install`.
4. Retrieve your Discord token. See this [token tutorial](https://github.com/davyvong/pokebot/wiki/Finding-Your-Discord-Token).
5. Start the bot using `npm start`.
6. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` using a browser.
